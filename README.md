# Caddy Multi-Tenant Configuration Hosting

This project demonstrates how to use  [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)  as a reverse proxy and configuration host for a multi-tenant application. Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open-source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go. It is designed to simplify the process of hosting and managing web applications.

In a multi-tenant architecture, a single instance of the application serves multiple tenants (customers), each with their own configuration. This project shows how to dynamically host and manage tenant-specific configurations using Caddy.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Tenant Configuration**: Host and manage tenant-specific configurations dynamically.
    
-   **Automatic HTTPS**: Caddy automatically provisions and renews TLS certificates using Let's Encrypt.
    
-   **Reverse Proxy**: Caddy acts as a reverse proxy to route requests to the appropriate backend services based on tenant configuration.
    
-   **Easy Configuration**: Caddy's simple and human-readable configuration format makes it easy to set up and manage.
    

## Prerequisites

-   [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install)  installed on your server.
    
-   A multi-tenant application with tenant-specific configurations.
    
-   A domain name with DNS configured to point to your server.
